            We found each other
            I helped you out of a broken place
            You gave me comfort
            But falling for you was my mistake

            I put you on top, I put you on top
            I claimed you so proud and openly
            And when times were rough, when times were rough
            I made sure I held you close to me

            So call out my name (call out my name)
            Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
            I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
            I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
            Girl, why can't you wait? (why can't you wait, baby?)
            Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
            Won't you call out my name? (call out my name)
            Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
            I'll be on my

            I said I didn't feel nothing baby, but I lied
            I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
            Guess I was just another pit stop
            'Til you made up your mind
            You just wasted my time

            You're on top, I put you on top
            I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
            And when times were rough, when times were rough
            I made sure I held you close to me

            So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
            So call out my name when I kiss you
            So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
            I want you to stay even though you don't want me
            Girl, why can't you wait? (girl, why can't you wait 'til I)
            Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
            Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
            Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way, girl
            I'll be on my

            On my way, on my way
            On my way, on my way, ooh
            On my way, on my way, on my way
            On my way, on my way, on my way
            (On my)
